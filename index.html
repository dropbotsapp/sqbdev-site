    <h1>SQB™</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Scoped logic. Predictable AI. Trusted interaction.</p>

    <p><strong>SQB™</strong> is a deterministic framework for deploying AI-assisted and non-AI digital systems with enforceable structure, scoped content boundaries, and consistent behavioral logic.  
    It powers DropBots, QClarity, and other systems where uncontrolled AI is not acceptable.</p>

    <h2>What Makes SQB™ Different?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Structured interaction trees</li>
      <li>Tiered AI control (from FAQ-only to constrained generation)</li>
      <li>Optional fallback logic (e.g. SQB™ structured AI Response when FAQs fail; directed to live human support)</li>
      <li>Transparent and inspectable layers - no mystery prompts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SQB™ Is Built For:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Client-facing workflows in legal, medical, and financial fields</li>
      <li>AI compliance environments where source control and audit trails are mandatory</li>
      <li>Embedded enterprise bots tied to internal knowledge systems</li>
      <li>Multi-language deployments with structured language-layering under one logic shell</li>
    </ul>
    
<h2 id="examples">SQB™ Use Case Examples</h2>
<p><strong>Structured Query Bot (SQB)</strong> governs how bots behave, what sources they use, and how far they’re allowed to go. Below are real-world contrasts that show how SQB-controlled bots differ from open-ended AI bots in sensitive applications.</p>
